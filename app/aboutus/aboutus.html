    <h1 class="display-4 text-warning my-4">About Us</h1>
    <p class="aboutus-paragraph">At Deedit.org we believe anyone can assist charities to raise funds.
        <br>So we've developed this cool platform where you can interact with video ads of brands, and in return they will donate money to a charity of your choise.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutus-paragraph">
        In other words, <span class="font-weight-bold">every ad you watch will generate a donation!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="aboutus-paragraph">
        With Deedit, anyone can be a philanthropist and become a Deeder from anywhere at any time.<br>
        It’s Simple, Free, Fun, and above all – IMPORTANT!            
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-warning mt-5 mb-1">The coins</h2>
    <p class="aboutus-paragraph">
        The golden coins symbolize the money donation that you raise.<br>
        All your coins will be collected with other users (Deeders) coins, and then we'll convert them to real money that will be given to the charities you supported.<br>
        Each charity has a status bar where we'll publish the amount of real money they've collected.   
    </p>
